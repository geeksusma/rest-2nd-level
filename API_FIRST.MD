# API FIRST EXCERCISE
## What is API FIRST

Is a concept that treats your API's as a first class citizen. It is standing to have consistent and reusable API's written in an API description language to stablish the contract.

There are some advantages about using this approach, but my favourite one is about reducing the feedback loop. Writing the API First, is useful to validate the design with any pair. Or even it is encouraging to you to make questions before jumping to the production codebase. Always to do changes in the design is going to be cheaper if they are detected at early stages.
